See Testing on departure for information on test locations.<br>\n • If your PCR test result is negative, you can proceed with your deployment. If your PCR test is positive, you will be subject to Liberia’s case management guidelines. This means NPHIL will consider on a case-by-case basis and you may be taken to a government COVID-19 treatment unit. Private health care facilities are not currently permitted to treat COVID-19 patients.

You should be prepared for travel restrictions, and changes to screening and quarantine requirements with no advance notice.\n <br>\n *Quarantine requirements: Depending on the length and reason for you visit, you may not have to isolate on arrival. However, for the majority of travellers Liberia recommends self-isolation for 7 days after arrival. Humanitarian works staying longer than 15 days will need to isolate on arrival for 7 days and then take a further PCR test. There is a risk for British nationals of being put into a government quarantine or medical facility, either on arrival or during your trip to Liberia. Liberian precautionary observation centre (POCs) are basic, and not guaranteed to meet Public Health England standards.<br>\n You are at risk of being put into quarantine or instructed to self-isolate even after completing your post-arrival self-isolation, if you develop symptoms (fever, cough or respiratory illness), or it is suspected you have been in contact with some who has tested positive for coronavirus. If you test positive for COVID-19, you may be transferred to a government quarantine facility or treatment centre. You are strongly advised to familiarise yourself with these risks before travelling.<br>\n If you are travelling on behalf of government, an international organisation/NGO or a company, you should check with your organisation whether they have pre-arranged a private POC, i.e. quarantine facility, authorised by NHPIL. The British Embassy cannot provide POC facilities. If you show symptoms, you may be transferred to a government POC or treatment centre.<br>\n Visitors arriving on a laissez-passer (except UN or EU), may also be taken to quarantine for secondary screening. Any suspicion of illegal attempts to circumvent the process will result in removal to quarantine.<br>\n *Testing on departure: Before departure from Liberia, you’ll need a negative COVID-19 test result, and a travel certificate issued by Liberia’s National Public Health Reference Laboratory. For exemptions, see Exemptions to PCR testing on departure.<br>\n • You must present a negative COVID-19 PCR test result, from a test conducted by Liberia’s National Public Health Reference Laboratory within 72 hours of departure.<br>\n • COVID-19 testing is available at the Union Center, located in Sophia, Congo Town, Monrovia from 9am to 4 pm 7 days per week. Sample processing could take several days.

All flights suspended until 30 April (Business Times, 02.02.2021). Yangon International Airport will be closed till May (Xinhua, 01.02.2021).\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  International Restrictions: \n *Entry to Myanmar: The government of Myanmar has suspended all international commercial passenger flights from any of its airports until 28 February 2021 at the earliest. It will then review the situation. Residents of the UK, or those who have visited the UK within the previous 14 days, are currently unable to enter Myanmar. Those not travelling from the United Kingdom, including British Nationals, should check the requirements for travel from that country to Myanmar with the relevant Myanmar Embassy or Consulate. If you are on a flight transiting via the UK, you will only be allowed to enter Myanmar if your transit time was for six hours or fewer. This is subject to short notice changes. Prior to travel you should check with the nearest Myanmar Embassy. New tourist visa applications are currently suspended. At present Myanmar authorities can offer business visas to foreign nationals with a compelling case. You or your employer must make your case to your nearest Myanmar Embassy and obtain permission. These arrangements are subject to change and at short notice. <br>\n *Testing/Screening on arrival: There are temperature checks for all arrivals. Arrivals must provide evidence of a negative COVID-19 test result. Testing requirements ahead of entry to Myanmar are subject to change. Confirmation should be sought from the relevant Myanmar Embassy or Consulate well in advance of your departure. <br>\n *Quarantine requirements: Arrivals in Myanmar must enter government-arranged quarantine. You will be allotted your quarantine facility on arrival. You may have no choice but will be placed in the same government quarantine facility or hotel as all the other people on your flight. You will be provided with food, for which you will be charged. The exact length of your quarantine will depend on your travel history. You should confirm your quarantine requirements with the relevant Myanmar Embassy or Consulate before you travel. Those arriving in Myanmar may need to abide by the following quarantine requirements: \n • complete 7 days home quarantine prior to the date of travel. This must be verified by an employer’s or doctor’s declaration, or a self-declaration. During these 7 days you may only leave your place of quarantine to take a COVID test;\n • provide evidence of a negative COVID test result;\n • complete 7 days quarantine in a government facility or government approved hotel on arrival in Myanmar (allocated on arrival);\n • undertake a COVID test after 7 days (through the National Health Laboratory, at a cost is MMK 200,000). If you test negative, you must complete a further 7 days of home quarantine, and will then be able to leave quarantine. If you test positive, you will be transferred to a designated government hospital for COVID patients. You will need to remain for 28 days in hospital, after which you can leave if you have tested negative for COVID for two consecutive weeks prior.\n These rules are subject to change at short notice, and the government of Myanmar can extend quarantine periods for a number of reasons, even for those who have been granted permission to undergo a shorter quarantine period. This includes if any person on a flight you might have used tests positive for COVID-19, or in response to the situation in a country you might have recently visited. You may be required to do more than one COVID-19 test before you leave quarantine, even if you test negative.\n If hospitalised with coronavirus, patients are obliged to use a government facility even if they have private insurance. Patients in government hospitals are generally expected to make their own arrangements for bringing in food and other essential supplies. Lone travellers will not be allowed out of isolation to buy food or make phone calls. These arrangements are subject to change and at short notice. Confirmation should be sought from the relevant Myanmar Embassy or Consulate well in advance of your departure. <br>\n *Data collection: Arrivals will be expected to provide contact details. We are not aware of any requirement to download an app.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  Internal Restrictions: *Travel in Myanmar:A limited schedule of domestic flights is operating, though the rules for access to these is not clear. You are advised to stay home at night, and minimise movement during the day, avoiding crowds. If you do still attempt to travel domestically, please note that you may encounter checkpoints on your journey. Prior to recent events, those taking a domestic flight inside Myanmar needed to take a COVID-19 test no more than 36 hours prior to departure. You may still be required to quarantine on arrival at your destination, particularly if you are coming from an area under a ‘Stay at Home’ order. You should contact individual airlines for details, and should comply with all the relevant guidance and regulations while travelling.<br>\n In some areas there may be local requirements for visitors from other parts of the country, including the requirement to take a COVID-19 test in advance of travel, and to quarantine on arrival. You should check with local authorities for information on possible local preventative measures. The majority of townships in Yangon are currently under a ‘Stay at Home’ order. Coco Island Region, Seikkyi/Khanaungto, Twantay, and Kwangyangon are not under a ‘Stay at Home’ order.<br>\n The rules for Yangon townships under a ‘Stay at Home’ order state that residents should stay in their own homes. Only one person per household is allowed to go out for essential supplies, or two people can leave the home to visit a hospital or clinic. Only the driver and one passenger can travel in a car at the same time, unless travelling to a hospital or clinic, in which case, there can be two passengers. Those who work in ‘essential private services’ are excluded from this order. Essential private services are defined by the government of Myanmar as banks, financial services, petrol stations, livestock and refrigeration industries, production and distribution of pharmaceutical products, production and distribution of drinking water and personal items. A curfew from 8pm until 4am each day is currently in effect in Yangon and other cities across Myanmar.<br>\n Other parts of Myanmar are also under ‘Stay at Home’ orders. You should confirm with the local ward administrator if you are unsure whether an area is subject to a ‘Stay at Home’ order. Anyone wishing to travel to or from an area subject to a ‘Stay at Home’ order may need to contact the relevant local authorities to confirm the requirements for travel.<br>\n This guidance from the government of Myanmar is subject to change, and you should check the information issued by the <a href=\"https://www.mofa.gov.mm/\">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> on their website and on their <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/mofamyanmar/\">Facebook page</a>\n  before you travel inside Myanmar. Further information is also available on the Facebook page for the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MinistryOfHealthAndSportsMyanmar\">Ministry of Health and Sports</a> and at their <a href=\"https://www.mohs.gov.mm/Home\">website</a>. If you are outside of Myanmar, you should refer to your nearest Myanmar Embassy. <br>\n Since 13 May 2020 it has been compulsory for anyone going out in public in Myanmar to wear a facemask. Failure to wear one will result in a fine. This requirement is being enforced strictly and has led to the arrest of some offenders. <br>\n It is recommended that foreigners carry: <br>\n • passport<br>\n • Form C (immigration document) <br>\n • Foreigner’s Registration Certificate<br>\n • Myanmar Driver’s Licence (if you own a car) <br>\n • a copy of your passport information page<br>\n • a copy of your Myanmar visa<br>\n • a copy of your immigration stamp showing when you last entered Myanmar. <br>\n *Accommodation: There have been reports that some local authorities are carrying out checks to make sure all foreign visitors are staying in registered hotels and guest houses, not in private apartments. This is a requirement under Myanmar law and is a condition of your visa. Some hotels have reopened but many tourist resorts remain closed. <br>\n *Public places and services: Some restaurants, bars and shops have reopened with temperature checks and social distancing measures in place. Some shopping centres may need customers to register their details upon entry. You must wear a face mask in all public places, and a face shield might be required in some locations. <br>\n The government of Myanmar ordered all schools, including private ones, to close from 26 August. The date for re-opening has not yet been announced. <br>",

If you do not wear a face mask you might be fined €95. Additionally, on platforms and stations, social distancing of 1.5 metres must be observed. <br>\n The Dutch government advises to limit your travel movements as much as possible. Public transport should be used for essential journeys only. For other shared forms of transport, such as taxis, passenger vans and coaches, reservations should be made in advance and you must wear a non-medical face mask. If you’re travelling in a car or other private vehicle, you are advised to wear non-medical face masks if there are two or more people in the vehicle who belong to different households. On other forms of transport, you must stay 1.5 metres apart where possible. <br>\n Schiphol, Eindhoven and Rotterdam Airports: All passengers and staff aged 13+ must wear face masks in all areas of these airports. The terminals are only open for passengers and staff. You must not be accompanied into the airport, unless absolutely necessary for a traveller with reduced mobility. <br>\n Ferries. DFDS: All travellers must wear face coverings at check-in, whilst boarding, and during disembarkation. This applies for both foot- and car passengers, as well as freight drivers. On the Amsterdam - Newcastle route, passengers must wear face coverings whilst moving around the ship. Face coverings do not need to be worn when travellers are in their cabins, seated in a socially distanced manner or whilst social distancing on outside decks. <br>\n P&O: All travellers must wear a face mask during their journey. <br>\n Eurostar: All passengers aged 13+ must wear a face mask at Eurostar stations and on board trains. If you don’t have a mask you may be refused travel on Eurostar services. <br>\n *Public Spaces and Services: Lockdown measures are in place across the Netherlands from 15 December 2020. A <a href=\"https://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19/tackling-new-coronavirus-in-the-netherlands\">full overview of the current Dutch measures</a> is available online. <br>\n A night-time curfew applies throughout the Netherlands as part of the Dutch Government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. You are not allowed to be outdoors between 9pm and 4:30am unless you have a permitted reason. See the Dutch Government’s <a href=\"https://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19/curfew\">website </a> for a list of permitted reasons. If it is essential for you to be outdoors during curfew hours, you must complete a self-certified declaration form, which is also available on the Dutch Government’s <a href=\"https://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19/curfew\">website</a> , along with a limited list of exemptions. <br>\n As of 3 March 2021, non-essential shops are open by appointment, which should be made at least 4 hours in advance. Supermarkets, bakeries, butchers and other shops selling food remain open. Other shops remaining open include pharmacies, chemists and petrol stations. Restaurants and cafes remain open for takeaway only. As of 3 March 2021, hairdressers and other contact-based professions will be open again. Gyms, museums, cinemas, zoos, amusement parks and other public spaces remain closed until further notice. <br>\n A full list of venues and services affected by the lockdown can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.government.nl/latest/news/2021/01/12/netherlands-to-remain-in-lockdown-until-at-least-9-february-inclusive\">Dutch government website</a> (in English). Wearing a face mask is compulsory for everyone aged 13 and over in all indoor public spaces. This includes shops, museums, cafes and theatres. You risk having to pay a €95 fine if you do not wear a face mask as directed. Outdoor group sizes are limited to no more than two people from different households.\n The Dutch government advises against all non-essential international travel until 15 April 2021 (inclusive). Holiday travel is not classified as essential by the Dutch government as is stated <a href=\"https://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19/tackling-new-coronavirus-in-the-netherlands/travel-and-holidays/travelling-abroad\">here</a>. <br>\n You should check the latest local information before travelling, as individual regions might have imposed extra measures. <br>\n You must stay 1.5 metres away from other people. This applies to everyone over the age of 18: in the street, in shops and other buildings. It does not apply to members of your household and it does not apply if you are providing assistance to someone, for example pushing a wheelchair. If you notice that it is becoming difficult to keep a distance of 1.5 metres, you should leave. Avoid busy places in general, as if a gathering poses a safety or public health risk, enforcement officers can take action. <br>\n *Accommodation: Foreign tourists are not obliged to reserve their holiday accommodation before travelling to the Netherlands. More information on visiting the Netherlands as a tourist can be found <a href=\"https://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19/tourism-in-the-netherlands\">here</a> and more information on Dutch coronavirus measures can be found <a href=\"https://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19/tackling-new-coronavirus-in-the-netherlands/basic-rules-for-everyone\">here</a>. <br>\n Hotels remain open, but hotel restaurants are closed and room service is unavailable. <br>",

This will come into force on flights arriving in New Zealand after 11:59pm (local time) on 25 January. New Zealand citizens and residents returning to New Zealand may travel to New Zealand and do not need any formal exemption.\n There are a small number of additional, limited exceptions to the ban on travelling to and entering New Zealand.

Arrivals must then test negative for COVID-19 before entering the community.\n Anyone travelling to New Zealand will be required to have a COVID-19 test on ‘day zero’, i.e. within 24 hours of arrival in a managed isolation and quarantine facility. Arrivals must remain in their managed isolation or quarantine facility room until the results of the test is known. You will then undergo further testing on Day 3 and Day 12 as required for all arrivals, in line with New Zealand’s policy on isolation and quarantine. Travellers to New Zealand will need to register on the Managed Isolation Allocation System as the first step to securing their place in a managed isolation facility. Before you book your flights, you need to register for a voucher for managed isolation. Your voucher allocates you a place in a managed isolation facility.\n For more information see <a href=\"https://www.miq.govt.nz/travel-to-new-zealand/secure-your-place-in-managed-isolation/\">Secure your place in managed isolation</a>. Provision of a voucher for managed isolation does not guarantee entry into New Zealand. You must first ensure you qualify to enter the country under New Zealand’s border restrictions. You can apply for your MIQ voucher up to 3 months in advance. New Zealand government is asking prospective travellers to regularly check the <a href=\"https://allocation.miq.govt.nz/portal/\">Managed Isolation Allocation System</a> website for preferred dates. There are a few exceptional circumstances in which people can apply for an exemption from managed isolation. Visit the <a href=\"https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-current-situation/covid-19-border-controls\">New Zealand Ministry of Health website</a> for more information.

On 11 August, the New Zealand government introduced legislation relating to charges for managed isolation for New Zealanders and permanent residents.

Russian government extends ban on flights to, from U.K. until 16 March (Reuters, 16.02.2021). \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  International Restrictions:\n *Entry to Russia: On 18 March 2020 the Russian government introduced restrictions on entry into the whole country for almost all foreign citizens. On 30 March 2020, temporary restrictions on entry and exit via Russia’s land borders were enforced. The duration of these remains unspecified. <br>\nCertain groups may be exempt from these restrictions, including people who are resident in Russia, those whose close family members are Russian citizens, members of diplomatic missions and highly qualified specialists. You should check the Ministry of Foreign Affairs guidance to see if you qualify and consult your airline before travel. Ministry of Foreign Affairs guidance also includes detailed guidance on the approvals and documentation you will need to have in place before you commence your journey. <br>\nOn 21 December 2020 the Russian government announced the suspension of direct flights between the UK and Russia. On 16 March 2021 the Russian authorities announced that the suspension would be in force until 11:59pm on 16 April 2021. Check with your travel company for the latest information. <br>\nUK nationals are currently unable to enter from a country other than the UK, unless they have documented proof of their citizenship of the country of their departure or permanent residence in the country of their departure and the Russian government has cleared the country for regular travel. Holders of diplomatic and other special visas are exempt from this requirement. <br>\nYou should check the specific COVID-19 test requirements airlines have in place in advance of your flight. Different airlines have different requirements and may refuse boarding if they are not met. <br>\nIn Moscow, express PCR COVID-19 tests are available in Sheremetyevo and Vnukovo airports as well as in a number of state and private clinics. <br>\nOn 15 December the Russian President extended the temporary measures to regulate the legal status of foreign citizens and stateless persons in Russia in connection with the threat of the spread of a new coronavirus infection. The grace period for Russian visas which have expired or will expire between 15 March 2020 - 15 June 2021 was extended until 15 June 2021. However, for nationals or permanent residence holders of those countries with which Russia had regular travel links on 15 December, including the UK, the grace period was only extended for 90 days, until 14 March 2021. <br>\nDuring the grace period, foreigners will not have to renew documents on temporary stay in Russia, including visa extensions, registration deadlines at the place of stay, temporary and permanent residence, including the extension of a residence permit. Besides, during the period of March 15 — December 15, 2020, no decisions will be made regarding deportation, repatriation or handover to another country of foreigners and stateless persons. <br>\nAlso, relevant governmental agencies will make no decisions on reducing the period of temporary stay in Russia and stripping a person of the refugee status, as well as on revoking previously issued visas, work permissions, patents and residence permits. Foreigners and stateless persons who are being released from prisons, violate border regulations or pose a threat to Russia’s national security or public order or participate in non-sanctioned mass protests/demonstrations/street marches are not covered by this provision. <br>\n*Testing / screening on arrival: Anyone arriving into airports will be temperature-checked. <br>\n*Quarantine requirements: The Russian government requires all arriving passengers to obtain and present a negative COVID-19 test certificate dated less than 72 hours before travel. Airlines may require you to show this on check-in and some airlines require the certificate to be no more than 72 hours before arrival in your destination (please check with your airline). You should arrange to take a private test. <br>\nOn 24 December 2020 the Russian authorities adopted a 14 day quarantine period for any travellers arriving from the UK. This includes passengers arriving for permanent work purposes including Highly Qualified Specialist (HQS) visa holders, who also have to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival in Russia. <br>\nYou will be required to self-isolate if you develop any symptoms of COVID-19 and/or if you test positive for COVID-19. You will be required to self-isolate until you have recovered and tested negative for COVID-19 on a PCR test. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities. <br>\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  Internal Restrictions:\n *Travel in Russia: The Federal Government has delegated responsibility for a gradual, phased relaxation of restrictions to the regional authorities. It is therefore possible different restrictions will be in force in different regions. You should follow regional advice.

    "info": "Latest News: \n  <br>\n  <br>\nInternational Restrictions:\n *Entry to St Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha: There are currently strict entry requirements to St Helena. Entry is only permitted to Saints and their dependents, long-term entry permit holders and those in service to the Crown in right of the Government of St Helena and their dependents. All arrivals must have had a negative COVID-19 test result within 72 hours prior to departing for St Helena. Arrivals are subject to compulsory quarantine for 14 days. All travellers to Ascension Island require an entry permit visa unless exempted by their occupation, such as active members of Her Majesty’s Armed Forces. Failure to enter with a valid visa is an offence under the Entry Control (Ascension) Ordinance and may result in a fine and imprisonment. Individuals may also be refused permission to land and be required to leave on the aircraft or vessel that they arrived on. Applicants should be aware that their applications may be affected by a change in the Ascension COVID-19 Response Level, particularly if this reflects an escalation of the seriousness of the COVID-19 threat on the island. During such circumstances permissions for certain types of entry permits may not be granted, and extant permissions may be revoked. <br>\n All arrivals to Ascension that have travelled from a COVID-19 infected area within the last 14 days, or travelled with others who have been in an infected area in the last 14 days, are subject to isolation restrictions for 14 days following their arrival at Ascension unless otherwise directed by the Senior Medical Officer. During this time their conditions are monitored for the development of symptoms which may be considered consistent with COVID-19. Air crews are also required to isolate for the duration of their stay on island. The Ascension Island Government will test all arrivals for COVID-19 before they exit quarantine. Countries currently defined as being an infected area are listed <a href=\"https://www.ascension.gov.ac/public-document/cv01n-notice-of-infected-areas-18-august-2020\">here</a>. During compulsory isolation, you will not be allowed to leave your accommodation unless directed to by local authorities or unless in an emergency. You will receive a daily welfare check from the local police detachment. All visitors to Tristan da Cunha require the authority of the Island Council in advance. <br>\n *Transiting South Africa en route to St Helena / Ascension / Tristan da Cunha: See entry requirements for South Africa. <br>\n *Testing/Screening on Arrival: All arrivals to St Helena will be subject to compulsory quarantine for 14 days and will require a test at the beginning and end of quarantine to check they are free of COVID-19. For those arriving by ship/yacht time at sea will count towards the 14 days quarantine period. All arrivals to Ascension may be subject to testing at their port of entry. If you feel unwell or develop COVID-19 symptoms during your journey, you should make the crew aware and they will ensure containment measures are implemented on arrival. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  Internal Restrictions:\n *Travel in St Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha: In St Helena, those arriving by air must quarantine in a property deemed by the authorities to be appropriate for quarantine or they will be taken to a government quarantine facility where they will spend 14 days. They will be tested for COVID-19 on arrival and again after 14 days. Any breach of quarantine may result in a fine of up to £5,000. There is no requirement for face coverings and there are no social distancing measures in force. Once new arrivals have completed quarantine, and tested negative for COVID-19, there are no local restrictions on travel within St Helena. Visitors can use taxis, public transport or rental cars to explore the island. Given its extreme isolation and lack of visitors, there is currently no social distancing on Tristan da Cunha. On Ascension you must wear a face covering from your port of arrival until you reach your isolation accommodation. Ascension’s Public Health (Coronavirus) (Temporary Measures) Regulations 2020, enables local authorities to enforce public health measures. The penalties for breaches of these Regulations consist of a fine of up to £5,000 and up to six months in prison. <br>\n *Accommodation: Hotels and other accommodation are open on St Helena. On Tristan, the only accommodation is government guest houses, which have to be arranged via the Tristan da Cunha Tourism Department well ahead of any proposed visit.\n On Ascension, all accommodation available to rent privately remains open as usual and is suitable for use during any period of compulsory isolation. <br>\n *Public spaces and services: Public places and services are open as usual and there are no restrictions on large gatherings. However, should Covid-19 present itself on any of the Islands, the authorities have the power to close public places and limit public gatherings.",

Ukraine government will ban flights over its territory by 13 Russian regional air carriers and Syrian Cham Wings Airlines for three years (Reuters, 27.01.2021).\n  <br>\n  <br>\nInternational Restrictions: <br>\nEntry and borders: Upon arrival, all non-exempt foreign nationals are required to provide proof of health insurance that covers COVID-19 observation and treatment for the duration of their stay. Insurance must be purchased from a company registered in Ukraine or a foreign company that has a representative office or an insurance partner in Ukraine. <br>\nFrom 24 March 2021, all non-exempt foreign nationals must also provide proof of a negative PCR test, taken no more than 72 hours in advance of their arrival in Ukraine. This does not apply to children under 12 years of age. Though the Ukrainian government is yet to set out the full details, presenting this test should also mean that foreign nationals do not need to self-isolate on arrival and do not need to download the <a href=\"https://visitukraine.today/#diya\">Diia Vdoma app</a>. This page will be updated with further details as they become available. <br>\nAccording to the resolution 1236 (9 December 2020) of the Ukrainian Government (Cabinet of Ministers), as updated on 22 March 2021, certain categories of foreign nationals are exempt from the insurance and PCR testing requirements: foreign nationals who are: residents of Ukraine; recognised as refugees; accredited diplomats in Ukraine, or members of accredited diplomats’ families; air, sea, and land transport crews; or military personnel from NATO or “Partnership for Peace” countries taking part in exercises with the Ukrainian military. <br>\nIt is not possible for non-exempted foreign nationals to take a PCR test once inside Ukraine, or self-isolate, in order to avoid the requirement for a pre-arrival negative PCR test. <br>\nThe final decision on a person’s eligibility to enter Ukraine rests with the Ukrainian State Border Service. The entry requirement policies of foreign governments are imposed and enforced at their discretion. <br>\n*Transiting Ukraine: Foreign nationals transiting Ukraine are required to provide proof of health insurance that covers COVID-19 observation and treatment for the duration of their stay.

The Uzbekistan Special Republican Commission has made changes to entry requirements for visitors arriving by air, rail and road which came into force on 1 October 2020. The Commission is monitoring the epidemiological situation in foreign countries, and has categorised them as Red, Yellow and Green. The UK is currently categorised as Red. This categorisation is subject to constant review and could change at short notice. Anyone arriving in Uzbekistan on a direct flight from countries categorised as green, and who have been in these countries for 14 days prior to travel, will not be required to quarantine or self-isolate. British nationals, once the temporary travel suspension is lifted, can only enter Uzbekistan providing they have a negative Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test for Coronavirus no more than 72 hours before their arrival into the Country. British passport holders can enter Uzbekistan for stays of up to 30 days without requiring a visa. Passengers who take a PCR test on arrival and who test positive will be quarantined for 14 days at a state facility or a dedicated hotel at their own expense. Passengers may also be subject to temperature checks on arrival into the Country. Passengers travelling or arriving from any Red or Yellow category countries, which currently includes the UK, are subject to a mandatory period of 14 days self-isolation on arrival. You should arrange to take a private test. Current restrictions are very fluid and are being assessed and monitored on a regular basis and are subject to change at very short notice. <br>\n *Transiting Uzbekistan: British nationals are currently not permitted to transit Uzbekistan until further notice. <br>\n *Testing/Screening on arrival: All arrivals into Uzbekistan are also subject to a mandatory COVID-19 express test on arrival and at their own expense.

Any person showing symptoms including high fever, coughing or respiratory difficulties will be will be required to undergo a test for COVID-19 and may be isolated at government facility (or approved hotel with medical and security controls in place) at their own cost. <br>\n *Quarantine requirements: Eligible visitors arriving in Uzbekistan from a country categorised as Green (Japan, South Korea, China and Israel) or who have been in one of these countries 14 days prior to arrival will not be subject to any mandatory quarantine or self-isolation period unless they display symptoms on arrival. No track and trace app is currently available. However, all visitors arriving into the country are registered by Uzbek Authorities. If arriving from a country categorised as Yellow or Red it is mandatory to provide the address where they will self-isolate for the 14-day period. <br>\n *Testing on departure: All persons departing Uzbekistan by air are required to undergo temperature checks. Anyone showing high temperature and/or other COVID-19 symptoms will be denied boarding. Depending on the destination country of the flight, the authorities of that country may also require other pre-boarding checks in addition to those conducted by the Uzbek authorities. <br>\n  <br>\n  <br>\n Internal Restrictions: \n *Travel in Uzbekistan: Civilian airports are open but scheduled international passenger flights are now very limited. Some domestic flights are operating. Public transport in cities has resumed and train travel between regions is now operating. Care should be taken if using taxis as some operators might not be fully complying with COVID-19 hygiene measures. Under measures introduced by the Uzbek authorities, anyone subject to quarantine or self-isolation who breaches such controls is liable to a minimum fine of 11 Million UZS or up to 10 years imprisonment.<br>\n *Accommodation: Hotels, motels and guest houses have reopened (but are subject to special health and safety rules) following the easing of restrictive measures.<br>\n *Public places and services: Persons aged over 65 are recommended to remain in self-isolation and not to visit public spaces.

March Victoria state government lifts ban on international arrivals from 8 April, makes adjustments to hotel quarantine system (Xinhua, 25.03.2021). Flights from PNG and Australia suspended (ABC, 17.03.2021). \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  International Restrictions: <br>\n *Entry to Australia: On 8 January 2021 the Australian National Cabinet agreed to additional domestic and international aviation measures:<br>\n Returning Australians and other travellers to Australia must return a negative COVID-19 test prior to departure. Exemptions will only be applied in extenuating circumstances, such as seasonal workers where there is limited access to testing. All passengers and air crew must wear masks on flights and in airports. Further details are available <a href=\"https://www.pm.gov.au/media/statement-national-cabinet\">here</a>. Only Australian citizens and returning permanent residents and their immediate family members are permitted to enter Australia without an exemption until further notice.<br>\n Travellers who meet exemption criteria or have a compassionate or compelling reason to enter Australia can <a href=\"https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/help-support/departmental-forms/online-forms/covid19-enquiry-form\">apply</a> to the Australian authorities for an exemption, For information on the exemption categories, application form and documentation needed, see the Department of Home Affairs <a href=\"https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/travel-restrictions-0\">website</a>. \n The Department of Home Affairs is experiencing high levels of demand for exemptions and there is no guarantee of either the timing of a decision or the outcome. You should make your application at least four weeks but not more than three months in advance of travel and provide full supporting documentation. <br>\n *Quarantine requirements: All international travellers entering Australia need to undertake a mandatory 14-day quarantine at a designated facility (for example a hotel) at their port of arrival. This is arranged by individual State and Territory governments. States and Territories are introducing charges for quarantine. These are already in place in New South Wales, the Northern Territory, Queensland and South Australia and are likely to be introduced in other States soon. For further details on quarantine including fees, see these websites:\n <a href=\"https://www.nsw.gov.au/covid-19/what-you-can-and-cant-do-under-rules/quarantine\">New South Wales</a> - if you made your flight booking before 11:59pm AEST on 12 July, you will not have to pay;\n <a href=\"https://coronavirus.nt.gov.au/stay-safe/quarantine/quarantine-fee\">The Northern Territory</a> - for further details including fees; \n <a href=\"https://www.qld.gov.au/health/conditions/health-alerts/coronavirus-covid-19/protect-yourself-others/quarantine\">Queensland</a> - if you made your flight booking before midnight on 17 June 2020, you will not have to pay; \n <a href=\"https://www.wa.gov.au/government/publications/paying-hotel-quarantine-wa-frequently-asked-questions\">Western Australia</a> - you may face a range of penalties for non-compliance with quarantine measures. <br>\n *Testing/Screening on arrival: All travellers arriving in Australia may need to undergo enhanced health screening on arrival before going into quarantine. This can include temperature testing. You may also be asked to undergo screening or testing in quarantine. The Australian authorities provide an <a href=\"https://www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-international-travellers\">‘Information for international travellers fact sheet’</a> to all travellers on arrival in Australia. This provides information on current requirements For advice and measures at individual airports, see their websites. <br> <br>\n *Transiting Australia: The Department of Home Affairs <a href=\"https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/transiting-australia\">website</a> sets out information on transiting Australia, including on transit visas. There are currently restrictions on transits due to coronavirus.\n You’re able to transit through Australia if transiting for 72 hours or less and you have evidence of onward international travel. If you intend to spend longer than 72 hours in Australia waiting for your connecting flight, you’re not considered to be transiting, and will need to request an exemption from the Australian Border Force Commissioner. Due to COVID-19 related border restrictions, you can usually only travel to Australia to transit to another country if your connecting flight leaves from the same airport. State quarantine requirements remain in place, and airport operating hours vary. This may limit how long you can stay in the airport, and whether you need to apply for exemption from Australia’s 14-day quarantine arrangements issued by the relevant State health authority. You should check with your airline, as well as on State and Territory <a href=\"https://www.health.gov.au/about-us/contact-us/local-state-and-territory-health-departments\">websites</a>for the latest details and how to apply. All airports should allow passengers to remain in the airport if your transit is less than 8 hours and on the same day. You must remain airside and you will not be able to pass customs (even to collect your baggage). You will need to maintain social distancing, cough etiquette and hand hygiene. At your first point of departure, you will need to have checked your baggage through to your final destination. If you have to leave the airport you will be taken on arrival in Australia to a designated quarantine facility by Australian authorities. You will need to remain there until proceeding to the airport for your departing flight. You may need to pay for quarantine - you should check State and Territory <a href=\"https://www.health.gov.au/news/health-alerts/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-health-alert/coronavirus-covid-19-advice-for-travellers\">website</a> for details on quarantine. \n If you plan to travel or transit on from Australia, check the latest entry restrictions for your destination and keep in touch with your airline, cruise line or tour operator before you travel.<br>\n *Leaving Australia: You should check the Department of Home Affairs website for information on leaving Australia, including whether you need an exemption.\n The Australian authorities continue to advise international visitors to leave Australia where possible due to the COVID-19 situation.\n Temporary visa holders do not need an exemption to leave the country, but will need an exemption if they want to re-enter – see the Department of Home Affairs ‘Coming to Australia’ web pages for more information.\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  Internal Restrictions: <br>\n *Travel in Australia: There are currently relatively few flights between States and Territories. If you need to travel, book in advance. Travel between and within some States and Territories within Australia is currently restricted. Restrictions can change at short notice and could disrupt travel plans. You should check individual <a href=\"https://www.health.gov.au/news/health-alerts/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-health-alert/coronavirus-covid-19-restrictions/coronavirus-covid-19-domestic-travel-restrictions-and-remote-area-access#state-and-territory-travel-restrictions\">States and Territory websites</a> for the latest information, including on whether you need to apply for an exemption to cross borders or are needed to self-isolate on arrival.<br>\n *Travelling to your international airport: Regardless of border restrictions, you may travel by air from one to another Australian State or Territory to another to transit to an international flight as long as you hold a confirmed booking for that flight. Where state borders are closed, you may need to apply for an exemption to cross borders. You will be need to stay within the airport for the duration of your transit, or if transiting overnight, you may be taken to mandatory quarantine for the duration of your transit or may need to self-isolate in a hotel. In Western Australia, your transit time must be no more than 24 hours. Given the fast changing situation, you should check <a href=\"https://www.health.gov.au/news/state-quarantine-requirements-for-interstate-travel\">State and Territory websites</a>for the latest information.<br>\n *Public spaces and services: Social distancing restrictions and other local measures are still in place across Australia with a number of variations. These are liable to change at short notice. You should monitor <a href=\"https://www.australia.gov.au/#state-and-territory-government-information\">State and Territory websites</a> for the latest information where you are and comply with these measures and other advice from local authorities. You can also check restrictions on the Australian Department of Health’s <a href=\"https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/covid19-restriction-checker\">COVID-19 Restriction Checker</a>. <br>\n Measures currently include: restrictions on numbers of people at most non-work gatherings, in shops, cafes, restaurants and other places of public gathering, and on visitors to private residences<br>\n • keeping at least 1.5 meters from others in public spaces<br>\n • restrictions on entering aged care homes<br>\n • limits on local travel and advice to avoid public transport at peak hours<br>\n • face masks on public transport and in crowded areas where it is difficult to maintain a 1.5 metres physical distance from others. <br",

Check with your travel agent or call Azerbaijan Airlines. <br>\n The use of a medical mask will be required at all times whilst at the airport and on the flight. It is mandatory to keep the mask on at all times except for specific requirements for example at border control, at the request of an airport official or whilst eating. Azerbaijan’s land borders with all neighbouring countries remain closed. <br>\n *Screening: All passengers travelling to or from Azerbaijan will require a negative COVID-19 test. Negative COVID-19 test certificates required for arrival in Azerbaijan no longer need to include a QR code, which when scanned must provide details from the clinic about the test results. However, airport authorities have advised that certificates without a QR code could face additional scrutiny and passengers could be delayed in passing through immigration. The test itself can be taken more than 48 hours before your flight, but the certificate showing the negative test result will only be accepted if issued within 48 hours of the flight’s arrival time in Baku. You should seek to have your test results via email and printed off, or a paper certificate. You may be tested again for COVID-19 and have your temperature checked on arrival into Azerbaijan. You should arrange to take a private test. <br>\n Anyone who displays symptoms of COVID-19 on arrival in Azerbaijan will be directed to the medical station at the airport. From there the case will be reported to the Emergency Medical Services. <br>\n All other passengers will still need to self-isolate for 14 days. It is possible to end self-isolation if you are tested again 6 days after arrival and the result is negative. You must arrange and pay for the test yourself with a private provider. You should keep hold of any negative certificate should you be asked to provide evidence of a negative test by the authorities. Many providers offer the option to be tested at home, as you are required to self-isolate until you are re-confirmed as being COVID-19 negative you should choose this service. <br>\n Foreign citizens who do not provide a negative COVID-19 test certificate on arrival may be refused entry to Azerbaijan and returned to their country of origin at their own expense – alternatively they may be required to enter state quarantine facilities. If you are required to enter a state quarantine facility you should contact the embassy using the instructions above. <br>\n If you are arriving to Azerbaijan via a third country (i.e. not directly from the UK) you will still be required to produce a COVID-19 negative test certificate on arrival even if your airline does not request one for boarding part of your journey. <br>\n *Testing on departure: All passengers travelling to or from Azerbaijan will require a negative COVID-19 test. As of 1 March 2021 all negative COVID-19 test certificates required for arrival in Azerbaijan must include a QR code, which when scanned must provide details from the clinic about the test results.

The Government of Cambodia has advised against travel between provinces inside Cambodia. Some provinces have introduced road blocks and entry restrictions. These are often not announced and procedures are not uniform. We recommend avoiding unnecessary travel around the country.<br>\nYou’re expected to wear a face covering when inside the airport and many airlines will ask for face coverings to be worn. While no penalties are currently being imposed by the Cambodian authorities for refusing to wear a face covering, our advice is to wear a face covering when requested to.<br>\n*Accommodation: Hotel and private rental accommodation is available throughout Cambodia. Some hotels have closed and remain so, and we advise that you contact hotels directly when booking. The majority of hotels will ask to take your temperature on arrival and ask you to complete a declaration in relation to your recent travel history and whether you have any symptoms related to COVID-19. Some services and facilities in hotels may not be available e.g. leisure facilities.<br>\n*Public places and services: Many public places and services such as gyms, casinos, karaoke rooms and nightclubs have been mandated to close or have closed due to a lack of custom. You should contact venues ahead of events.<br>\nOn 11 March the Government of Cambodia brought in a law on <a href=\"https://www.akp.gov.kh/post/detail/228560\">“Preventive Measures Against the Spread of COVID-19 and Other Severe and Dangerous Contagious Diseases”</a>.

This exclusion does not apply to temporary foreign workers, most international students, Canadian citizens and permanent residents or their immediate and extended families provided they remain in Canada for 15 days or more. Anyone arriving in Canada must self-quarantine for 14 days, and have a credible self-isolation plan.

Documentation of a negative laboratory test result must be presented to the airline prior to coming to Canada. The test must be performed using a COVID-19 molecular test within 72 hours of boarding a flight to Canada. Passengers without a negative test will be denied boarding.

People displaying symptoms of coronavirus when they arrive in Canada may not use public transportation to travel to their place of isolation. They also may not isolate in a place where they will be in contact with vulnerable people, such as elderly people and those with underlying health conditions.\n In addition to the mandatory pre-departure tests, from 22 February, all travellers arriving in Canada by land and air, with some exceptions, will be required to take an additional test on arrival, and another toward the end of the 14 day self-isolation period. International travellers arriving at Toronto Pearson airport are already required to take an additional COVID-19 test on arrival.

Heavy penalties apply if you fail to comply. You must also produce a credible self-isolation plan. An inadequate plan would include scenarios such as planning to stay with elderly family members or failing to have a set destination. Travellers who are unable to produce a credible plan will be placed in a quarantine location, such as a hotel, for a 2-week period. <br>\n Authorities in Alberta are piloting a voluntary testing scheme for travellers arriving in Canada at Calgary airport or via the Coutts land border crossing from the US, to shorten time spent in self-isolation. Further details are available on the <a href=\"https://www.alberta.ca/international-border-pilot-project.aspx\">Government of Alberta’s website</a>. The scheme will be suspended upon introduction of mandatory testing on arrival from 22 February. <br>\n With limited exceptions, air travellers arriving from 22 February will be required to reserve, prior to departure to Canada, a 3 night stay in a government-authorised hotel at their own expense. Travellers will be able to book their government-authorised stay starting 18 February 2021.

There are some regional variations, but they generally include: • a ban on large social gatherings, where physical distancing is not possible; • closure of some public facilities, museums, cinemas and theatres in affected cities and regions; • curfew or closure of bars and restaurants in affected cities and regions; • some public transport offering only a limited service; • mandatory wearing of face masks in indoor public settings<br>\n *Public spaces and services: Anyone showing symptoms associated with coronavirus will be barred from domestic flights and some inter-city train services. Non-medical face masks or face coverings are required for all flights to and from Canadian airports, and within airport terminals. Anyone who cannot wear a face mask for medical reasons must be in possession of a medical certificate. <br>\n The Canadian authorities recommend the use of non-medical masks/facial coverings when it is not possible to consistently maintain a 2-metre physical distance from others, including on public transportation. Some local transport authorities are making this a mandatory requirement. You should ensure that you are in possession of a mask/facial covering when using public transport in the event you are requested by transport operators to wear one. <br>\n Federal, provincial and local authorities may introduce further restrictions at short notice, including the requirement to wear a face mask or face covering in public or enclosed spaces, closing provincial borders, internal travel restrictions, a provisional ban on temporary foreign workers, or mandatory self-isolation for people arriving from other provinces.

The Chilean authorities have closed all ports to cruise liners.\n  <br>\n  <br> \n Internal Restrictions: <br>\n*Travel in Chile: Travellers arriving in Santiago should be aware that local authorities are frequently moving municipalities (comunas) back and forward through the quarantine Stages Plan (Paso a Paso). You should check on the <a href=\"https://www.gob.cl/coronavirus/pasoapaso#situacioncomunal/\">Chilean Government Paso a Paso website</a>. <br>\nIf you are travelling from or to the airport to catch a flight from or to one of the areas under quarantine or curfew, presenting your passport and boarding pass will permit you to cross any checkpoints. Use a recognised taxi service or airport transfer whose driver should have the requisite permissions. The government has introduced a special holiday permit (Permiso de vacaciones) (until 31 March 2021) for residents in comunas in ‘Transition’ or Stage 2. This does not apply to tourists or non-resident foreign nationals, only to Chileans and foreign residents. For more information, please see the <a href=\"https://www.gob.cl/pasoapaso/\">official Chilean advice</a>. <br>\nChilean authorities require the use of face masks in all public spaces / public transport, including the airport. You risk a significant fine for not wearing a mask in public. <br>\nQuarantine orders and sanitary cordons are in place in Santiago and in other parts of the country. There is currently a nationwide curfew (between 10pm and 5am, seven days a week). If you have a medical emergency or funeral during curfew times, you must <a href=\"http://www.comisariavirtual.cl/\">issue a permit (Salvoconducto) online</a>. <br>\nBe aware that if you wish to travel to Magallanes Region, you will need to provide proof of a negative PCR-test result given within 72 hours prior to travel. <br>\nChile is deploying a flexible approach to bringing municipal areas (called comunas) in and out of quarantine/sanitary cordons. New measures can be announced by the government at any time and come into force shortly after. <br>\nOn 28 July, local areas (“comunas”) in Chile that were under lockdown, as part of the Chilean government’s 5stage plan, began to move from quarantine (Stage 1) into less restrictive stages. The rules on mobility in each stage are as follows: <br>\nStage 1: Quarantine. Restricted mobility; permits required for essential activity only from Monday to Friday; Evening curfew between 2200-0500, social distancing and cordon sanitaire in place; obligatory quarantine for those over 75, except on Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays between 0900-1100 for 60 minutes or between 1600-1800; prohibition of movement to secondary home. Outdoor exercise activities are allowed from Monday to Friday between 0700-0830. On weekends and bank holidays between 0600-0900. <br>\nStage 2: Transition. Quarantine remains in place at weekends and bank holidays social gatherings of no more than 5 people allowed inside; Evening curfew between 2200-0500, social distancing and cordon sanitaire in place and a prohibition on movement to other regions. You can travel to other regions or ‘comunas’ only with a special holiday permit until 31 March 2021. Outdoor exercise activities are allowed from Monday to Friday. On weekends and bank holidays between 0600-0900. <br>\nStage 3: Preparation. Under this stage there are no mobility restrictions within the comuna; social gatherings capped at 15 people; Evening curfew between 2200-0500, social distancing and cordon sanitaire in place; and interregional travel is only allowed to regions in Stage 3, 4 and 5. You require a special holiday permit if you are travelling to a secondary home located in a region in Stage 2. In/Outdoor activities are allowed. <br>\nStage 4: Initial opening. Significant step that aims to re-open certain low risk activities and to avoid crowds and physical contact. Establishment of a new way of living: COVID MODE. Social gatherings with no more than 30 people permitted; cinemas, theatres, restaurants and cafes allowed to function at 25% capacity; restaurants and cafés allowed to open to the public at 25% capacity; Evening curfew between 2200-0500, social distancing still required; pubs and clubs remain closed; over 75’s allowed to leave their homes for 60 minutes per day;. Interregional travel is only allowed to regions in Stage 3, 4 and 5. You require a special holiday permit if you are travelling to a secondary home located on a region in Stage 2. <br>\nStage 5: Advanced opening. This step relies on the population becoming accustomed to activities in COVID MODE. Social gatherings with no more than 150 people permitted; cinemas, theatres, restaurants and cafes allowed to function at 75% capacity; gyms, pubs and clubs can function at 50% capacity; gradual return to physical classes in education establishments. Social distancing of 1 metre; free movement for those over 75 and movement to secondary homes allowed. <br>\nThe Government’s <a href=\"https://www.gob.cl/pasoapaso/\">‘Paso a Paso’ website</a> outlines which phase-out stage each comuna of Chile is under the heading (‘Situación Comunal’). <br>\nIn areas in quarantine you are only allowed to leave your residence under certain circumstances, including for medical reasons, basic services, and public services.

In addition to checking the health of persons passing through, these checkpoints will be used to confirm that specific individuals who have been ordered to quarantine by medical authorities are not violating their quarantine. You will need to get a <a href=\"https://www.c19.cl/\">“Health Passport”</a> prior to travel and present it at any checkpoint. <br>\n*Public places and services: Chilean authorities require the use of face masks in all public spaces, irrespective of what stage of the quarantine phase-out a comuna is in.\n\n",

International airlines may only maintain one route to China, operating one flight per week. <br>\n *Entry and transit: You will need a valid visa to enter China. The Chinese Visa Application Centres in London and Belfast are closed until further notice. The Application centres in Manchester and Edinburgh will be closed from 27 December until further notice.<br>\n The Chinese authorities have suspended all direct flights from the UK. This measure will be subject to review but no date has been announced. Restrictions on travel to China from other countries, and the necessary requirements, may be different. British nationals travelling to China from a third country should follow the directions on the website of the local Chinese Embassy or consulate for requirements from that country. <br>\n On 4 November the Chinese Embassy in the UK announced the temporary suspension of entry into China by non-Chinese nationals in the UK holding Chinese visas or residence permits. Entry by holders of diplomatic, service, courtesy or C visas would not be affected. Foreign nationals visiting China for emergencies can still apply for visas at Chinese Embassies or Consulates and entry by non-Chinese nationals in the UK with visas issued after 3 November 2020 will not be affected. <br>\n If you’re issued a visa to travel from the UK to China in these circumstances you will need to submit a Health Declaration Form to your nearest Chinese Embassy or Consulate in the UK before you travel, who will need to certify your form and return it to you via email. The Chinese Embassy announcement of 4 November stated the Chinese Embassy and Consulates have suspended issuing Certified Health Declaration forms for non-Chinese nationals in the UK holding visas or residence permits. More details, including the process for submitting forms for those still eligible, can be found on the <a href=\"http://www.chinese-embassy.org.uk/eng/visa/notice/t1806517.htm\">Chinese Embassy website</a>. <br>\n In order to receive a Health Declaration Form from the Chinese Embassy you must provide evidence of negative nucleic acid and IgM antibody tests for COVID-19 taken no more than 48 hours before you travel. <br>\n Reports of both your nucleic acid (COVID-19) and IgM (antibody) tests must come from the same service provider. This does not mean the provider must carry out both tests, but that the provider must guarantee both test reports. You should arrange to take a private test. <br>\n A limited number of international flights from other countries are flying into Beijing. Other international passenger flights to Beijing continue to be diverted to 16 designated airports in Chengdu, Changsha, Hefei, Lanzhou, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, Hohhot, Jinan, Qingdao, Nanjing, Shenyang, Dalian, Zhengzhou, Xi’an and Wuhan. A small number of international flights are also operating direct between European cities and Shanghai, Guangzhou and Qingdao. <br>\n *Health checks on arrival: All overseas passenger arrivals are subject to health checks on arrival (likely involving nucleic acid or swab tests). Those failing health checks may be sent to a designated hospital for treatment. Health regulations surrounding passengers arriving from overseas are continuously changing. You should contact the Chinese Embassy in your country before you travel if you have any questions regarding these entry requirements, quarantine rules or the requirements for individual cities. <br>\n *Quarantine requirements: Following health checks on arrival, you will then need to enter quarantine for at least 14 days. At some points of entry children 14 and over will be required to quarantine alone irrespective of whether they test positive or negative for COVID.\n You will be separated from your child if one of you tests positive for coronavirus. If this happens to you, you can call +86 (0)10 8529 6600 for 24/7 urgent consular assistance. Non-residents may be charged for their care. For further information on healthcare in China, please see the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/china/coronavirus\">Coronavirus section</a>. <br>\n Quarantine is usually spent at either a centralised government hotel (with costs covered by the traveller) or your home. Quarantine requirements can change at short notice and may differ from province to province. <br>\n Follow-up swab tests are likely to take place during your quarantine period. Family members of someone who tests positive, or those who have been in close contact, will need to go into a government quarantine hospital. For all quarantine arrangements in China: <br>\n • unless directed by the authorities you’re not allowed to leave your designated quarantine location for 14 days. This means you’re also unable to leave China for the duration of the quarantine<br>\n • depending on the quarantine location, facilities may be basic: there may be no fridge, no air-conditioning, and limited or no internet/wifi<br>\n • during your stay you will be responsible for cleaning the room<br>\n • if meals are not available at the quarantine location, you will need to arrange food orders for delivery from outside<br>\n • larger sized families with two parents may be separated into 2 rooms. <br>\n • if you’re on prescription medication make sure you bring enough with you to last for at least 3-4 weeks together with medical documents certifying that you need to take this medication. See <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/china/health\">Health</a> for further information.<br>\n Failure to comply with the quarantine conditions or testing put in place, or any attempts to deliberately conceal health conditions can result in being sentenced to up to three years in prison. This applies to both Chinese and foreign nationals.\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  Internal Restrictions: <br>\n *Travel in China: Mandatory requirements to check temperatures and use health apps or scan QR codes to prove travel history are in place at transport hubs, hotels, commercial buildings including restaurants, residential compounds and other locations – such locations are also increasingly needing the use of ‘health kit code’ apps to demonstrate health condition and travel history. <br>\n Restrictions on movement and quarantine arrangements remain for travel between different parts of the country. Some cities and provinces need travellers from high to medium risk areas to undergo 14 days of isolation in their place of residence or in centralised observation. Quarantine is enforced at the neighbourhood level and procedures vary, so check in advance. <br>\n The possibility that local authorities impose mandatory quarantine in response to fresh outbreaks is high. There have been reports of individuals who have frequented bars or restaurants where there have been confirmed cases of COVID-19 being mandated to undergo 14 days of centralised quarantine. You should keep up to date with the latest developments and this travel advice. <br>\n There have been reports of discrimination against foreign nationals in China as a result of a perceived risk that they might re-import COVID-19. In Guangzhou, in particular, there have been reports of discrimination on the basis of ethnicity, especially of those who are black and minority ethnic, including additional enforced quarantine and testing, as well as hotels and businesses not serving clients.",

Children are not exempt. You should arrange to take a private test. You will still be given a PCR test on arrival in Cuba. Everyone has to complete a Health Declaration (with the address of where they will be staying) and have a PCR test. From 1 December, all air tickets will have a sanitary fee of $30 included. If you have to pay for a PCR test, e.g. arriving by boat, the cost is payable by credit card, or in USD or GBP or Euros cash. The test result should be communicated within 48 hours. Travel insurance with cover for COVID-19 is required.<br>\n *Screening and quarantine: Tourists arriving on holiday charter flights will be given a PCR test on arrival. You will then be transferred to their hotels, and will be briefed on isolation rules there and further medical checks or testing at the hotel. Non-residents will be given a PCR test on arrival and will have to stay at a designated isolation centre (may be a hotel) until they have a second negative PCR test (the test may be on fifth day). The costs of the stay, test(s) and transport to and from the accommodation have to be paid by you, by credit card. It is recommended to bring cash in case your credit card does not work. Cuban nationals will also have to stay in a designated isolation centre until their second negative PCR test result. As will foreign residents of Cuba. The designated place of isolation for foreign residents will be specified by the relevant Ministry, e.g. MINCEX in the case of foreign business officials, MINREX for foreign media, and Ministry of Higher Education (MES) for foreign students. If your first PCR test is positive (even if you arrived with a certificate of a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of your departure to Cuba) you will have to go into hospital or centre being run by Ministry of Public Health. The costs of the stay in hospital or centre (and any medication) must be paid by credit card when discharged, or payment will need to be arranged directly by your travel insurance company. As a contingency, it is worth bringing cash (GBP, US Dollars or Euros) to settle the bill.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n Internal Restrictions: <br>\n *Travel in Cuba: Travel and transport within and between Provinces varies according to the measures in place. Any change in the situation in a province or municipality may mean inter-provincial or municipal transport links also change. Travel in and out Havana is restricted from 12 January 2021 through specific check points with sanitary controls, and (public and private) transport services in Havana will only operate between 5am and 9pm.<br>\n From Friday 5 February 2021, a curfew is in place in Havana between 9pm to 5am which applies to any movement of vehicles and persons.

Visitors are allowed to hire cars (see important information in <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/cuba/safety-and-security\">Road Travel</a> section) but should check with the hire companies if they are open, have cars available, and check where you can drive to under current COVID-19 measures, before making plans. Check with your tour operator and seek local advice if you have questions about excursions to other parts of Cuba, including whether car hire is allowed.<br>\n *Accommodation: Hotels and guest houses are open but to a limited occupancy. Guests may have to wear face masks in some hotel areas and facilities. Campsites are open also to a limited capacity. Medical teams in hotels will check on health of guests, including taking their temperature, and will be available to guests who feel unwell in between those visits. Local medical representatives will visit campsites and “casas particulares”. Anyone with respiratory symptoms may be moved to a clinic or isolation centre and will have to pay for PCR test(s) and the medical services by credit card. Any travelling companion may be required to self-isolate in their accommodation pending a negative PCR test result, or be tested themselves. Hotels may limit the numbers of people using facilities at any one time, especially swimming pools (if open) and elevators.<br>\n *Public spaces and services: Wearing a face mask in public is compulsory or you risk being fined, as is social distancing of a minimum of 1.5 metres. Shops in all Provinces can open but must limit the number of customers within the shop. This means there are queues to enter shops.<br>\n From 13 January, shops in Havana will only be allowed to open between 9am and 5pm on Monday to Saturday and between 9am and 1pm on Sunday. Shops can only open to sell essential food and hygiene products.<br>\n Cafés, bars and restaurants (except in Havana from 13 January) are allowed to open but must limit the opening hours, the number of customers and separate tables by 1.5 metres.

As of 1 June 2020, international commercial flights have resumed operations to and from Ecuador. However, following the identification of a new variant of Coronavirus, we highly recommend you contact your airline/travel company to check your travel itinerary. <br>\n*Testing / screening on arrival: Upon arrival, all passengers will be required to sign a health declaration form with their itinerary and local contact details. They must also present a negative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) qualitative test for COVID-19, or a negative antigen rapid test, taken up to 3 days prior to their arrival in the country. This is a mandatory requirement which airlines are responsible for enforcing in order to allow passengers to board. <br>\nAs of 22 March 2021, travellers who have had their complete COVID-19 vaccination can present the official vaccination certificate instead of the above negative RT-PCR or rapid test result. However, the use of “Immunity Certificates or Vaccination Certificates/Cards” from foreign passengers will be subject to constant review. <br>\nPassengers who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 through a positive RT-PCR test, if over a month has passed since the beginning of the symptoms, and who continue to show a positive test result, can be exempted from the above general requirement to enter the country (only if they no longer have symptoms, and if they present an official Medical Certificate which certifies their health condition, issued in their country of origin). <br>\nOnly airline crew members, children under 2 years old and passengers on transit to other countries are exempt from the RT-PCR or Antigen rapid test or the COVID-19 vaccination certificate requirement.\nIf, on arrival, a passenger presents COVID-19 related symptoms, they will be evaluated by a health care worker and if necessary will be taken to the nearest health centre for a full evaluation. <br>\n*Quarantine requirements:  Passengers who test positive in the antigen test taken at the airport will need to self-isolate for 10 days. Self-isolation for non-residents can be carried out in any hotel. Local residents and people qualified as “priority attention groups” such as people over 65 years old, children and pregnant women, will be allowed to self-isolate at their homes.

The Government will monitor the situation in other countries with high risk of contagion to prevent incoming flights. <br>\n*Travel to and from the Galapagos:  From 1 July, tourist activities are allowed in the Galapagos Islands. Commercial flights connecting the Islands resumed on 3 August. The local authorities have created a ‘safe travel corridor’ for travel to the Galapagos Islands. Foreigners wishing to enter the islands must present a negative Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test for COVID-19, taken 96 hours prior to the date of departure to the Galapagos islands. On arrival in Ecuador tourists may be requested to take another PCR test, at their own expense. Tourists must also present a return flight and a safe passage document (‘salvoconducto’) issued by the Ministry of Tourism to be exempt from doing 14 days of self-isolation on the islands. The tour operators or hotels are responsible for arranging this safe passage document on behalf of tourists, given that visitors are required to have previous contracted travel and accommodation arrangements. The Galapagos Transit Control Card, will need to be filled out online at least 24 hours before the flight. On arrival in Ecuador you will be required to fill in a Health Status Declaration, including a local address. Travel health insurance is mandatory for foreign tourists.

However, Ecuadorean nationals and foreign residents may be allowed to enter Ecuador via the Rumichaca and Huaquillas northern and southern borders; <br>\n • ports remain closed for travel/tourism activities. Only cargo services are allowed. \n <br>\n *Restrictions: The central government´s “red, amber, green” alert system is no longer in force. However, it will be used as an internal management tool for epidemiological monitoring. Each municipal government is responsible for determining its own specific restrictions including, but not limited to, maximum capacity for public transport and institutions, operations capacity of private businesses, the circulation of private vehicles against licence plate numbers, health prevention protocols for all businesses and industries and alcohol consumption. We recommend you follow the local municipalities’ social media channels to obtain the most up to date notifications, but bear in mind that these might change at any time:\n Quito: @MunicipioQuito; Guayaquil: @alcaldiagye; Cuenca: @MunicipioCuenca; Galapagos: @CGGalapagos\n Ecuador’s National Emergency Operations Committee (COE) has a website with their <a href=\"https://www.gestionderiesgos.gob.ec/resoluciones-coe/\">official resolutions</a> (Spanish only). Within the national health emergency, the Ecuadorean Ministry of Health will continue to issue the required health prevention measures, including PCR tests and any mandatory self-isolation (Aislamiento Preventivo Obligatorio – APO) requirements. <br>\n *Restrictions in Quito: Quito Municipality continues with its campaign to increase testing and triage. In addition to adhering to the standard general biosecurity measures, you must also carry an identity card at all times.

Only people who work for certain vital sectors, such as health, food provision, financial and emergencies, will be allowed to circulate on the days which the vehicle’s number plate would not normally be permitted to circulate. You must present valid credentials or proof of emergency if stopped by a local authority. The Municipality can issue special <a href=\"https://secretariademovilidad.quito.gob.ec/index.php/hoy-no-circula-2021\">safe passage documents</a> (“salvoconducto”) for private vehicles that can justify their need to circulate outside the “Hoy Circula” restrictions (passenger transfer to and from the airport, and medical appointments). Inter-provincial bus transport operation has been authorised by local municipalities, at 75% capacity, from/to bus terminals. Accredited tourist transport vehicles are not subject to any mobility restriction.\n As part of the Municipality´s regular monitoring of the pandemic situation, the Quito Metropolitan Emergency Operations Committee has issued new temporary restrictions that will be in force from 15 February to 31 March 2021. All public gatherings are suspended. Pubs, nightclubs and gyms are also closed until further notice.

You will receive test results on the same day. This could take 8 or more hours. Passengers arriving in the afternoon and evening will need to wait for test results overnight, and will be temporarily accommodated in the Department of Health Holding Centre for Test Results (HCTR) set up in the Rambler Hotel in Tsing Yi. Please note that children under the age of 16 cannot stay at the Rambler Hotel unaccompanied. Parents who stay with their child at the HCTR on the first night whilst awaiting test results, will have to continue to self-isolate for the full 14 days. If travelling unaccompanied, there is a risk that a child may have to stay alone overnight at the airport on arrival while awaiting test results.
